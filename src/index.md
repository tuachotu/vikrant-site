# Hi, I am Vikrant.

At home I run a small but lively setup. A curious daughter, a golden retriever who believes he is the product owner, and a wife who is definitely the CEO of our little startup called life.

By profession I have spent more than two decades working on the hidden parts of the internet. The backend systems that quietly keep things running while the frontend gets all the attention. My journey started in the C++ days and took me through large scale platforms at Yahoo and Meta, into fast growing startups like KeepTruckin, and now to Autodesk where I continue to build privacy aware and highly available backend platforms.

Along the way I have seen big rearchitectures, real world distributed systems, and a couple of layoffs as well. Those experiences have a way of sharpening your understanding of what really matters in work and in life.

Outside of day to day coding I am deeply interested in how technology shapes human behaviour. Especially the subtle ways social platforms influence how we think, connect and drift apart. It often feels like watching a distributed system of humanity evolve in real time. Fascinating, powerful and sometimes a little unsettling.

If you have an interesting problem or an early stage idea that deserves to be built with care, I would love to hear about it.
I usually move between Portland, OR and San Francisco, CA.

Let us build things that age well.
